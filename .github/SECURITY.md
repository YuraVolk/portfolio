## Supported Versions

Only the website release is subject to potential vulnerability reportings.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Since this is a static landing page, it should be noted that there is no need to report security vulnerabilities.
Security vulnerabilities are exceptionally rare and can only be related to potential tokens leaks, which should be reported as a security vulnerability.
Write out the detailed steps on how to reproduce the issue through private vulnerability reporting, describing the environment if neccessary.
